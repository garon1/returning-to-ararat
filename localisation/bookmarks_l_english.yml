 AZR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After Azerbaijan won its independence, it was met with immediate war from the Armenians and Georgians. Although Zaqataly was kept, Azerbaijan was froced to give up the Armenian populated regions of Karabakh. Since then, economic collapse swept the nation, and it wasn't until the 1927 elections that the Social Liberals were able to take Azerbaijan out of its dark path. But it seems ever so likely that path will re-emerge, and they may be easily taken advantage of by their neighbors, if they are not careful..."
 ARM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Armenia has completely changed since 1894, and when the treaties were signed in 1896, Armenia was able to finally able to become unified once again. When Russia collapsed in 25, Armenia finally achieved their independence. Now, Armenia has seen stability and government support rise. Although this is the case, their neigbours are not happy about Armenia's territorial gains, and they just might threaten Armenia's entire social order if they're successful..."
 ARA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom Of Arabia, born after the crumbling Ottoman Empire was able to achieve nation-wide stability and growth by the early 1900s. In 1919, the Kingdom was able to defeat the British and take control of their West Asian colonies. But, Arabia is in a tough place. Reformists and non-reformists often clash, and as history as shown, if reform and improvement is not met in time, it can can be fatal for any nation..."
 GRE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1896, the Megali Idea was fully realized after Greece won the Sasoun Rebellion. However in their territories, ethnic tensions boiled over but thanfully the democratic party in charge was able to calm the situation. But many oppositions are forming. What they don't realize is that the social order shall be disturbed if the Democratic party is voted out. This could spell doom for the Megali Idea and Greece as a whole... "
 EGY_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1919, a revolt against the British in Egypt caused a whole war that lead to the decline of the British Empire. Egypt was granted independence after 1919, emcompassing Sudan as well. Egypt since then has been escalating situations with their European neigbours, especially with anti-colonial sentiment. Egypt longs to "liberate" European Africa, but if they do, it could put the very existance of Egypt at stake... "
 HAI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After 1934, Haiti was able to miraculously win a war against the Dominican Republic, annexing 2/3 of the county, reducing it to a peninsula. Although they were successful, the US appears to be looming over the Carribean, to finish what they started. If America launches a war, Haiti might have to fight to the very last man to keep its existance..."
 BOL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1934 the greatist military achievement came to the Bolivians. They forced Chile to give up 1/2 of its country to Bolivia, which they took their claimed coast and puppeted the rest of occupied territory. Although Bolivia has an advantage over Chile, they and their American allies might strike at any time. If the Bolivians don't keep a watchful eye on their neighbours, their gains in 1934 might be reduced completely..."
 SIA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the British were embroiled in war in 1919, Siam saw an opportunity. They launched a full on war in Asia, which its primary goal was Siamese irredentism. They were successful, even annexing all of Singapore. In the years after, Siam would become a regional power but its government would just become corrupt as time goes on. Peace is fragile, and if Siam is not able to pull itself together all the progress Siam as made will be useless..."
 KUR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When Kurdistan was born in 1896, it was full of problems. Thousands of refugees had flooded the small country, and Kurdistan was not nearly as big as was hoped by nationalists. Kurdistan faced many more problems in 1925 when they gained their independence, but thankfully when they joined the DOWA they helped Kurdistan industrialize and improve. But since Kurdistan is very small, they have no choice but to rely on others, which may or may not cause their downfall..."
 ASS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Assyria when it began went through a major political and demographic shift in its borders. Now Assyrians finally had a homeland, and many had begun to settle in the country. But since then, their closest allies, Arabia has become more nationalistic, with some politicians declaring Mosul to be Arabian. Assyria needs to find as many allies as they can get, because peace is always temporary."
 TAJIKISTAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When Tajikistan and Kyrgistan declared their independence from the collapsing Russian Republic, they were left with almost nothing. A disgruntled population rebelled, and formed the United Turkic Union. Miraculously, against all odds they were victorious against all Central Asian nations. Today, they remain the most powerful Turkic country, but, considering they made so many enemies along the way, who knows if that status will be kept in the years to come..."
 PORTUGAL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although Portugal had a rough start to the 20th century, as by 1922 Portugal suffered 2 revolution. One against the monarchy in 1908 and another one deposing the new republic in 1922 after the Portugese people were fed up with democracy.\n\nBut it seems like the light might indeed shine on Portugal again. After 1931 Portugal one several new colonies from the British, and public support for the government skyrocketed. Although Portugal is relatively stable, they must always keep an eye out, or their Empire will suffer the consequences..."
 SPAIN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Spain's time as a great power had come and gone, and they were seen as nothing more than an unimportant nation in European politics. Despite this, Spain was able to gain respect from European powers from the Cairo War. Despite this, public support is at an all time low. Right and Left radicals are waiting for the perfect time to strike, and if they do, it will severely disrupt the power balance in the region, and Spain might suffer the consequences..."
CAU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the victorious revolutions of Central America from the 1920s-1930s, almost all of the region were under socialist and syndicalist forces. After America attacked Panama, it was decided that Central America should unify against American imperialism, and after the war, Central America has prospered as a new nation. But the Americans are always a thorn on their side, as they still control Panama. The small border they share could cause the entirety of Central America to collapse..."
VIN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ever since Vietnam gained its independence from the Republic of Indochina in 1928, the country has seen Vietnamese culture thrive with its syndicalist economy.\n\n Secretly though, they hold ambitions. Many in the Vietnamese government hold sympathies to the idea of a united syndicalist Indochina, and many are willing to put Vietnam to war for those ambitions. Whether it will be fully realized or whether it results in Vietnam collapsing from the inside, only time will tell..."
CRO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since Croatia gained its independence from the collapsing Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, the country has constantly battled with Serbia over Bosnia, an ethnically mixed and divided land between them.\n\nThe Situation is not better either, being ruled by a nationalist totalitarianist. If Croatia will fully commit and liberate Bosnia, they must fix their internal issues. Fast."
CHL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Chile for years had seen peace while the rest of the world saw war. That was until 1934, when Bolivian troops broke the front lines and marched right into Santiago. Even after the peace agreements, unrest was the norm until Espejo and his men violently crushed the unrest. But since then life has gotten worse, and Espejo's military regime is numbered, that much is known. What isn't is how Chile could, or even if it can survive in the upcoming years..."
PERSIA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "For the first 20 years of the 1900s for Persia, was marked with exploitation and weakness by foreign powers, mostly by Britain and Russia. But after Russia underwent its peaceful revolution and after Persia participated in the Cairo War, all foreign influence was gone from the state, with the addition of British Baluchistan and Omar. But after, Persia has been beaten down by various problems, in part due to the ineffecient modernization of the country. If they will ever find their place in the world again, they need to fix their problems, and they can not wait anymore..."
RUS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the Russian Civil War ended in 1927, Russia was left fractured, no longer holding any Black, Mediterranean or Caspian Sea port. Vladivostok, Petrograd, Minsk, Warsaw and many more cities were lost, and the Russians were left in the poorest country in Europe. To the citizens, it showed the Republic was ineffective, and in 1930, the Russian Fascists ran and won the election, promising their former glory and the return of "Rightfully Russian Territory."\n\nNow, as war looms, no one is certain whether Russia will win their territory, or collapse trying..."
SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After Russia collapsed into civil war, the peasants and proletariat revolted in Moscow and St. Petersburg. But after 2 years, only St. Petersburg was the last bastion for the communists. But both sides were too exhausted from war, and as a result, signed a ceasefire that remains to this day. Nationalist Russia has not forgotten the humiliating losses, but the Russian leftists of Petrograd will not back down without a fight. It is clear that this peace is temporary, but for Socialist Russia, if they make one mistake, it could spell doom for them..."
QNG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the successful monarchist revolt in Nanjing, monarchist China was recognized by all Chinese warlord states, even including Japan. After the revolt was over and peace came back, cities like Nanjing and Shanghi prospered with peace as trade flowed through the country.\n\nDue to the many years of peace, many are hoping for the time when the monarchists bring monarchy back to all of China. But many fear Monarchist China is not that strong, and may die fighting..."

 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The globe, since the infamous Partition of the Ottoman Empire has become unrecognizable, and to some degree that is not good. 'Peace' seems ever so distant, different than what it was mere decades ago. Britain wants to take their former colonies back, Central America wants to spread communism beyond its borders, while America, now divided and broken, hopes to re-assemble itself.

A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Despite the devastation of the Great War, France has been on the road to recovery thanks to a strong economy. However, the Depression has still affected the country and the new German regime has no interest in paying the war reparations stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nWhen the treaty was signed, a French marshal famously remarked that it was not peace, but an armistice of 20 years. Those 20 years are now rapidly running out."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the fall of the young Weimar republic of only 2 years, the SPRG has risen. Thanks to their intervention, new syndaclist nations have been established, as well as a defensive alliance.\n\nHowever, Germany is faced with problems.

As the Italian Empire expands, so does its economy, gaining more and more influence within the Mediterranean. \n\nHowever, after 1919, Italy and France banded together when Britain severed ties with each country. Now, although Italy remains a prominent European power, it has some weak spots. If Italy is so survive, she must patch them up, before they're exploited..."

Whichever route Japan takes, it might very well risk the decades of time spent uniting ad creating a powerful Empire..."

Once a nonexistant nation, and in a matter of 2 years, dominates Eastern European politics and is heavily influential across the European continent. \n\nPoland allied itself with Ukraine and other states for protection against the Russian menace, but Russia seems to be growing in power and influence.

They went from suffering from a poor goverment, to a civil war, to stability, to now being the most stable Portugal has been in decades, thanks largley to the Monarchist party and annexation of British African territories in the South African War.\n\nBut it seems like war will be back, and possibly the few years of Portuguese peace may be cut short in the coming future..."

From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."

 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In the last few years the world has seen some new wars break out in Europe and Asia. Spain is now governed by nationalists and Japan has fought both the Soviet Union and China for territory, the latter being a more successful battle for Japan.

 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the French and the British grew increasingly suspicious of Germany's intentions. The Munich Agreement gave Germany permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its German people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union, but also specifies the partitioning of Poland between the two nations. \n\nGermany has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War is raging in the Southeast. Even though Japan suffered some losses early in '39, a big portion of Chinese territory is under Japanese control. Tension is rising in Europe, and while the Soviet Union is focusing their attention on those matters, they shouldn't interfere in the war in Asia. \n\nWhen China's resources are in Japanese hands, the Soviets will be easy to deal with."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Mussolini, the dictator of Italy, achieved some fame as a peace keeper for his part in the Munich agreement a year ago. However, German territorial expansion has made Italy see there is more land to claim if an understanding with the Germans could be reached. \n\nAlbania has been conquered merely as a taste of Italy's military capabilities, and the rest of the world would do well to worry."
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Soviet Union stands in relation to Italy and Germany. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Soviet Union currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germany to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world.

In recent years, however, the country has concerned itself mostly with domestic matters, and the government of King Carol II has allowed these alliances to lapse. \n\nAs the political situation in Europe changes, Romania may well find herself standing alone - and vulnerable."

 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the revolution that deposed the last of the Qing Emperors, the young Chinese Republic has struggled to survive. Warlords rule much of the land on the periphery. In the heart of the country, the Communists have set up a base area in a remote mountain valley. Just beyond the borders, the Japanese have created a puppet government under the last Chinese Emperor and will try to reunite the country under his rule.\n\nWith many enemies threatening it, the government of Chiang Kai-Shek will have to make hard choices if it wants to survive and rule supreme in China."
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A mere two years ago, the Communist Party of China faced utter annihilation. To survive, it engaged on the epic journey that would become known as the Long March. With only a fraction of the army surviving the rigors of the march and little industry, the prospects of victory in the Chinese Civil War are slim indeed.\n\nBut in time, the population may be swayed to the Communist cause, new armies be raised, new base areas established, and, when the time is right, the revolutionary struggle will be renewed again, until final victory is achieved."
 CHI_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After two years of war against the Japanese, the armies of Chiang Kai-Shek have bled themselves white trying to stop the assault. The enemy has overrun the richest areas of the country. Little support has been forthcoming from the western democracies, and the Communist seem unwilling to engage the enemy in open battle.\n\nWith the war threatening to spread even further, it appears that the worst is still to come. But as the Japanese attack is slowed by the vastness of the country, they may well turn their gaze in other directions, and new alliances may yet turn the tide..."
 PRC_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Faced with an all-out Japanese attack, the Nationalists and Communists have struck an uneasy truce. Both sides are well aware that this United Front can not last. The Communist base area in Yan'an now forms the front line in the war against the Japanese.\n\nThe Communists must husband their resources carefully if they want to survive. Any casualties suffered in the fight against Japan will be felt twice over when the time comes to fight the war against the Nationalists, and this may well be what the government of Chiang Kai-Shek is counting on..."

 WARLORDS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The weakness of the Central Government may yet provide the opportunity for a sufficiently ambitious man to rise to power. At the periphery of the country, local leaders have carved out their own little fiefdoms, caring little for the orders of the Central Government. \n\nWar is on the horizon, and each of these Warlords faces a difficult choice: Collaboration with the Central Government or an alliance with the Communists? Either option promises a chance for a seat at the table, but there is a third possibility - to take China all for themselves."

The day will come when it has outlived its usefullness, and on that day the game is once again open for every man ambitious and ruthless enough to make a play for the title of Ruler of China."

Perhaps withdrawal to the colonies is the only possible means to resist such an invasion..."
 NETHERLANDS_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War between Germany and the other European major powers seems inevitable, and though the Netherlands has put its faith once again in its neutrality, its leaders are contemplating making secret staff plans with their southern neighbours in preperation for possible hostilities.\n\nThe army has been mobilized, and work on the Dutch defensive lines is increasing in pace in an attempt to get the country as ready as possible to defend against any infringement of its sovereignty. Should this fail, there are always the colonies..."
