l_english:

# This is the overwrite file for vanilla localisation, anything here will replace the vanilla localisation of the same string
# It is broken up into two parts
# Part one is significantly changed (like has a totally new meaning) from vanilla and needs translating
# Part two just has spelling and grammar fixes, so doesn't need to get translated
